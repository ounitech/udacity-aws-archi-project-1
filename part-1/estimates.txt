Multi-AZ, multi-Region RDS

1-Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Given that DB config is multi AZ, an AZ outage will have no impact and RTO is 0

2-Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Given that DB config is multi Region, a Region outage will have a small RTO. The read-replica will have to be promoted to primary.
RTO is dependent on many parameters, it is about 5 minutes

3-Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Given that DB config is multi AZ, an AZ outage will have no impact and RPO is 0

4-Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Given that DB config is multi Region, a Region outage will have also a small RPO. It is the time needed to detect region failure and promoting the read-replica.
RPO is also dependent on many parameters, it is about 5 minutes. Note that we have a daily backup.
